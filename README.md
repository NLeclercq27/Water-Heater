# The Water Heaters library

### Description
This Python library allows to model electrical or heat pump water heaters, including effects such as stratification, ambient heat losses, convection and advection. It can be used for the simulation of individual units, or to create a pool of water heaters used as a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) providing services to the grid.
 
### Features
The model is a linear model with the following features:
- aa
- bb

### Quick start

If you want to download the latest version from github for use or development purposes, make sure that you have git and an [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/) installed and type the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NLeclercq27/Water-Heater.git
cd Water-Heater
conda env create  # Automatically creates environment based on environment.yml
conda activate waterheaters # Activate the environment
```

The above commands create a dedicated environment so that your conda configuration remains clean from the required dependencies installed.

To check that everything runs fine, you can run the python files provided in the scripts folder.
